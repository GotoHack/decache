Decache

-----

Decache is a simple utility to extract working and completely valid files from an iOS dyld shared cache.

Compilation:
  Link your theos directory to ./theos
  Edit the makefile to determine native (OS X) vs iphone (iOS)

Usage:
  decache -c /path/to/cachecache -x <file to extract> [-o <out file name>]

Notes:
  A full listing of files can be determined via '-c /path/to/cache'
  Wildcards and batch dumps are not supported.  However, decache does partial string matching (e.g. '-x UIKit')
  Scrambled memory mapped caches suck.
    On iDevices, decache reads the entire cache into memory (eating your precious RAM) rather than using mmap.
    On OS X, you need a non-scrambled cache.  Both scp and rsync return scrambled caches; use afc instead.
  Also, I do not add code signatures.  Sorry!
