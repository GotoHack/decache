Decache

-----

Decache is a simple utility to extract working and completely valid files from an iOS dyld shared cache.

Compilation:
  Link your theos directory to ./theos
  Edit the makefile to determine native (OS X) vs iphone (iOS)

Usage examples:
  To list all files in the cache
    decache -c <cache>
  To dump the entire cache
    decache -c <cache> -o <output dir>
  To dump just one file
    decache -c <cache> -x <file to extract>
    decache -c <cache> -x <file to extract> -o <output path + filename>
  
Notes:
  Wildcards are not supported.  However, decache does partial string matching (e.g. '-x UIKit')
  Scrambled memory mapped caches suck.
    On iDevices, decache reads the entire cache into memory (eating your precious RAM) rather than using mmap.
    On OS X, you need a non-scrambled cache.  Use afc or figure out how to call F_GLOBAL_NOCACHE before using scp/rsync.
  Also, I do not add code signatures.  Sorry!
