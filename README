Decache

-----

Decache is a simple utility to extract working and completely valid files from an iOS dyld shared cache.

Usage:
  decache -c cache -x <extract name> [-o <out file name>]

Sorry, wildcards are not yet supported.  So you have to extract the individual files.   However, you can use an option like "-x UIKit".  

Also, I do not add code signatures.  Sorry!
